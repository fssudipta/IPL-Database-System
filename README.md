# IPL Database System

This is my Level 1 Term 2 database project, "IPL Database System," developed using JavaFX and Java. By applying the key principles of Object-Oriented Programming, I have structured the files to ensure all necessary components are easily accessible.

The key features of the project are as follows:

1. Maintaining a database for the given players.txt file.
2. For each club, managing the player list with detailed player information easily accessible.
3. In each club, you can buy or sell players. Note: Once a player has been sold from a club, you cannot re-buy the same player for that club. However, the player can still be purchased if you log in from a different club.
4. You can add new players to a club by inputting the necessary information. 
Note: Jersey numbers are carefully managed to avoid conflicts.
5. The system includes a unique and user-friendly filter system, such as filtering by country, position, range, and club-specific information.


For better understanding, I will add a YouTube video demonstration later.

N.B.: User have to run the server.java at first, then you have to run the client.java file. Once the app has started, you have to sign up for each club. And you have to remember the password for each club, as for security purpose, I have not kept any .txt file for maintaining a password database. 
Then sign in to each club and then you can have the full access to the app.
